                            <p> Step 1 Soak potato strips in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes <p>                          
                            <p>Step 2 Pat with paper towels until thoroughly dry.</p>
                            <p> Step 3 Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Gently add potatoes to the hot oil and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring and flipping the potatoes occasionally.
                            </p>
                            <p>  Step 4 Use a slotted spoon to transfer potatoes to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool completely..</p>
                            <p> Step 5 Heat oil again, but this time to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add potatoes and fry a second time until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.</p>
                            <p>  Step 6 Remove from the deep-fryer and blot with a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt to serve.</p>

                            <p> Step 1 Using a fork, gently incorporate the flour into the egg mixture a little at a time.
                                Once you have incorporated all of the flour together with the egg using a fork, switch to a bench knife or bench scraper if you have one, or use your fingertips to really blend the mixture together.</p>
                             <p> Step 2 After the wet and dry ingredients have been well combined using the dough knife, bring the mixture together with your hands to form a ball. If the dough seems too dry, beat an extra egg and add some of it to the dough a little at a time. You might not need a whole extra egg. You need to end up with a dough that doesn't stick and is malleable, so more moisture is sometimes needed.</p>
                            <p>
                              Step 3  Once you have a dough that is easy to handle, doesn't stick to your hands, and keeps its shape when formed into a ball, knead the pasta dough as you would with bread dough.</p> 
                            <p> Step 4 Using the bench knife, cut the dough into 3 equal sections. Alternatively, you can weigh your dough and divide it into 3 equals parts.
                                Form each section into a ball, and cover the dough balls with a towel or bowl. Let rest for 15 minutes.</p>
                             <p>Step 5 After the dough has completely passed through the pasta machine, turn the slot down to the next smallest setting and pass the dough through the slot. Continue to do this, making the slot smaller by 1 each time. Don't try to skip a number, as this will only cause the machine to jam and you'll end up with a crumpled dough. 

                                As you continue rolling the pasta, your sheet of dough will get longer and longer. Try to gently hold the dough as it exits the pasta machine so it doesn't tear. 
                                
                                Continue passing the dough through the machine until it's about 1/16th of an inch thick.</p>
                            <p>Step 6 Most pasta machines come with an adapter that cuts the dough. You may wish to cut your dough in half to make it easier to handle.

                                Feed the dough into the cutting blades. Try to have your hand under the center of the cut dough, so you can pick it all up in one bunch.</p> 
                            <p> Step 7 Immediately after cutting the dough, hang the pasta on a dowel or other object like a clean clothes drying rack. Alternatively, lay the pasta flat on a towel, and use some semolina to keep it separate. 

                                The pasta can be used right away in heavily salted boling water or kept in the fridge covered for up to a week. </p>
                            <p> Step 8 If you're using a rolling pin: 

                                Flatten one of the dough balls and start using the rolling pin to shape it into a long rectangle. Use your arm strength to press firmly while pushing away from you with the rolling pin. The rectangle you end up with should be 4 to 5 inches wide and as long as needed so you can see your hand through it or read a printed page of a book when putting it underneath the dough. 
                                Fold the ends of the rectangle into the middle, and then the ends again twice more. Leave to rest for 5 minutes.
                                Cut the edges of your dough with a very sharp and clean knife to make it even. Then cut strips of about 1/3 to 1/2 inch wide. </p>

                            <p>Step 9 Enjoy!</p>

                    <p> “Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast in the warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface.
                        In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the middle and add the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture. Using a spoon, mix until a shaggy dough begins to form.
                        Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes. The dough should be soft, smooth, and bouncy. Form the dough into a taut round.
                        Grease a clean, large bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning to coat with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for at least an hour, or up to 24 hours.
                        Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead for another minute or so, then cut into 4 equal portions and shape into rounds.
                        Lightly flour the dough, then cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for another 30 minutes to an hour while you prepare the sauce and any other ingredients.
                        Preheat the oven as high as your oven will allow, between 450-500˚F (230-260˚C). Place a pizza stone, heavy baking sheet (turn upside down so the surface is flat), or cast iron skillet in the oven.
                        Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce: Add the salt to the can of tomatoes and puree with an immersion blender, or transfer to a blender or food processor, and puree until smooth.
                        Once the dough has rested, take a portion and start by poking the surface with your fingertips, until bubbles form and do not deflate.
                        Then, stretch and press the dough into a thin round. Make it thinner than you think it should be, as it will slightly shrink and puff up during baking.
                        Sprinkle semolina onto an upside down baking sheet and place the stretched crust onto it. Add the sauce and ingredients of your choice.
                        Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or pan. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust and cheese are golden brown.
                        Add any garnish of your preference.
